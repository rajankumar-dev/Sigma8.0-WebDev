# 🌙 Dark Mode Toggle Button

A simple and responsive Dark Mode Toggle Button built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how to implement theme switching functionality between light and dark modes for a web page — a must-have feature in modern web applications!

## 🔥 Features

- ⚡ No external libraries required  
- 📱 Responsive and mobile-friendly

## 📁 Project Structure

```
dark-mode-toggle/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── style.css          # Styles for light and dark mode
└── script.js          # JavaScript for toggling theme
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The button (or icon) listens for a click event.
2. On click, JavaScript toggles a `dark` class on the `<body>` (or main container).
3. CSS applies different styles based on the presence or absence of the `dark` class.
